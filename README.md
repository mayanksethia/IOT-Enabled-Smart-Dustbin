# IOT-Enabled-Smart-Dustbin
This prototype was made as a project for my course of IOT in 2018. We developed a smart dustbin that would segregate metallic and non-metallic waste using sensors such as capacitive and inductive sensors etc. Waste segregation is a very important issue in today's world and we took up this problem and tried to solve it through our product. Please find attached the complete report which contains all the details of how we made it from scratch along with the youtube link for the same.
